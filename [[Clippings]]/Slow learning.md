**1\. Focus on direction, not destination**  
Immerse yourself completely in the journey and you will reach your final goal gradually.

**2\. Raise your hand**  
Asking questions is a fundamental human right.

**3\. Learn at your own pace**  
Find your rhythm, find your flow. Don’t compare yourself to others.

**4\. Unplug**  
You have the right to disconnect and move your attention towards what’s essential. Learn unplugged, far away from digital distractions.

**5\. Change your learning path (and mind)**  
Don’t get too comfortable in the habit zone and start with changing the aversion to change. Think differently and learn new things.

**6\. Take a break**  
Micro-breaks, lunch breaks, and longer breaks will all improve your learning performance. You have the right to rest.

**7\. Make mistakes**  
Don’t fall into despair but Fail Forward.

**8\. Leave it unfinished**  
We live in a super busy, multi-tasking, results-oriented society. Step away from your long to-do list and enjoy once in a while the beauty of an unstructured day.

**9\. Unlearn and forget**  
Harness the power of unlearning. Reboot your mind, abandon old knowledge, actions and behaviours to create space.

**10\. Slow down**  
Sometimes slow and steady will win the learning race. Make haste slowly.
