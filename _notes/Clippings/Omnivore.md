Omnivore is the free, open source, read-it-later app for serious readers.

Distraction free. Privacy focused. Open source. Designed for knowledge workers and lifelong learners.

Save articles, newsletters, and documents and read them later — focused and distraction free. Add notes and highlights. Organize your reading list the way you want and sync it across all your devices.

## Save it now. Read it later.

Save articles, PDFs, and Twitter threads as you come across them using Omnivore's mobile apps and browser extensions. Read them later using our distraction free reader.

## Get all your newsletters in one place.

Send newsletters directly to your Omnivore library rather than scattered across multiple inboxes. Read them on your own time, away from the constant distractions and interruptions of your email.

## Keep your reading organized, whatever that means to you.

Keep your reading organized and easily available with labels, filters, rules, and fully indexed text searches. We're not here to tell you how to stay organized — our job is to give you the tools to build a system that works for you.

## Add highlights and notes.

Become a better reader — engage your brain and improve retention by reading actively, not passively. Highlight key sections and add notes as you read. You can access your highlights and notes any time — they stay with your articles forever.

## Sync with your second brain.

Omnivore syncs with popular Personal Knowledge Management systems including Logseq and Obsidian, so you can pull all your saved reading, highlights, and notes into your second brain.

## Listen to your reading with text-to-speech.

Work through your to-be-read list and give your eyes a break with TTS, exclusively in the Omnivore app for iOS. Realistic, natural-sounding AI voices will read any saved article aloud.

## Open source means you're in control.

Reading is a lifetime activity, and you shouldn't have to worry you'll lose your library after you've spent years building it. Our open-source platform ensures your reading won't be held prisoner in a proprietary system.
