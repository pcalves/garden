 Many fans of the legendary Japanese trio Yellow Magic Orchestra were first exposed in early 2017 to founding member Haruomi Hosono’s *Watering a Flower*, an odd and mysterious collection of three ambient tracks supposedly released solely on cassette in 1984. But this latter descriptor verges on half-truth. Posted to YouTube in January 2017, and quickly gaining a reputation as a neglected (and now finally uncovered), essential work in Hosono’s oeuvre, *Watering a Flower* is actually a recontextualization of music originally released on cassette as *花に水* in 1984, with not three tracks but two, and with entirely different cover art.

 These differences may seem trivial, but I intend to do my best to make the argument that they are anything but, and that in fact there exists something incredibly intriguing and worthy of discussion within the way that this music has resurfaced.

original cassette artwork

 A Discogs entry claims that the original cassette “Comes with book” and also includes the essential information that “These works were commissioned by a consumer goods shop Muji as shop background music in 1983.” I found a [Japanese wiki article](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8A%B1%E3%81%AB%E6%B0%B4) that when translated gives some more details about the original cassette release, including that the book’s “contents are composed of photographs, Mr. Kobuyama Masahiko and Hosono’s interview, Nakazawa Shinichi’s column, Haiku and so on.” This article alludes to the rarity of this particular release.

Exploring various other web sources like this allows one to fill in the some of the rest of the backstory, but all of the details remain vague, and so *Watering a Flower* is shrouded in something of a veil of obscurity.

Many albums have gained cult status in the past few years due to being uploaded to YouTube and becoming frequently recommended links for those using the site as a way to listen to out-of-print or inaccessible albums. But, as aforementioned, *Watering a Flower* is presented here in a form that it never before existed in. RateYourMusic user blebbio in his review describes:

*“This album does not exist in a historical sense but speaks to the history or reinvention of history we are all involved in through the internet and archiving and database websites…*

*…With the internet it has become much easier for reality and history to be changed by misinformation and collective acceptance and spreading of inaccurate information. That may seem inherently bad but this album shows that recreating history can actual recreate good things just as it has the potential to create bad. In the past those with authority to record history were much fewer and only allowed by those already with power. However now anyone with an internet connection can create an album release entry on RYM or upload an album to youtube.”*

Haruomi Hosono

**The history:**

MUJI was a Japanese product line of packaged food and various other household products. In 1983, they opened their first stand-alone store, commissioning Hosono to compose background music for which to play in the store. Supposedly only one of the three tracks was ever used, and the original cassette release, as aforementioned, only contained two of the three tracks.

MUJI still exists. I am entirely unfamiliar with the store, although they do have US locations. From a little online research it seems that they push a simple and minimalist aesthetic, so the commissioning of Hosono to make ambient shop music falls in line with their branding.

Ikko Tanaka MUJI poster (2000)

 The YouTube upload, which has entirely repackaged the release, includes a poster by Ikko Tanaka (who was at the time hired as the art director of MUJI). Tanaka was MUJI’s art director until 2001 and is (apparently) largely responsible for the visual aesthetic of the company. Scrolling through collections of some of his posters online, they feel designed in line with a hip minimalist aesthetic: to me they recall both mid 20th century Polish film posters and color field paintings.

As blebbio has alluded to, this re-contextualization of Hosono’s music with a related image by Tanaka has further increased the mystique of this new version of an old recording – as Tanaka’s eerie and now-vaguely-vaporwave-reminiscent art (the particular poster that was selected, moreso than any others I have come across in my online searches, compares to some of the trademark vaporwave elements) serves to better represent the music than the image Discogs claims is the original cover. It allows the current audience (mainly record enthusiasts and internet music nerds) to connect to what seems entirely uninteresting (music composed to be played as background noise in a shop).

Furthermore, due to the rarity of the original tape issue, this lucky resurfacing of the material allows music unique within Hosono’s vast body of work to achieve a level of accessibility that would otherwise have been unheard of. The internet, the great leveler, the behemoth that constantly alters the canon of popular music, can see fit to unearth the obscure and place it alongside the best-seller. It is not ridiculous whatsoever to suggest that *Watering a Flower* will go on to be more well-known and discussed than Hosono records like *Omni Sight Seeing*, *Medicine Compilation: From The Quiet Lounge*, or *N.D.E.* (if RateYourMusic is any indication, *Watering a Flower* boasts roughly a hundred more ratings than any of these).

**The music:**

*Watering a Flower* is something of a masterpiece – an exceptionally eerie collection of ambient pieces that seem bizarre when one considers they were intended to be played as background music in a shop. The opening track ‘Talking’ is by far the eeriest (it predates, but compares to, Junichi Masuda’s ‘Lavender Town Theme’ from *Pokémon Red and Blue* in both the timbre of sound and the unsettling atmosphere). What initially sounds warm and cheerful gives way over the course of fifteen minutes, as the metronomic dinging remains constant, but the synthesizer melody subtly distorts and changes, creating an uncannily uncomfortable sense of disorientation among stagnation. It is at once soothing and horrifying, and the listener can gradually shift their mentality between the two moods by focusing in on and imbedding their imagination into various conflicting qualities of the music. Accompanied by the original artwork ‘Talking’ feels probably more serene, but with the YouTube-added Takada poster, it becomes this sinister uncovered thing – more reminiscent of the realms of CreepyPasta or deep web than a consumer goods shop. Strange, foreign, uncanny.

It’s quite possible that Hosono was aware of the unsettling elements of a piece like this – or that he was subtly indulging in that uncanny image as it related to 1980s Japanese consumer culture, as sly commentary. But more likely this attests to ambient music’s ability to shapeshift and change through context and idiosyncratic reaction. I can attest to the way that this album makes lying in bed at night in the dark a strange, unnerving and magically creepy experience. I’ve done it on multiple occasions – and I manage to drift to sleep comfortably despite how creeped out the music generally makes me. I can’t imagine the effect it would have on shopping, especially intended as background noise rather than as a listening focus. This shift from true ambiance to a center of attention changes everything about the music.

So this music, which is deceptively simple and stagnant on first glimpse, becomes this shifting puzzle box depending on the context in which it is placed. Whether it is calming or unnerving, an art piece or a product of marketing, all depends on its situation.

**Context, as in history:**  

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfQyv7OaivQL3nr2YjrVteSYj9UcOtwqSOjnhZu9P5j4ujtTrhEXWfkWUJQlJNWeL69DGgTQIJr9K0ERvLvgaWG36po598q1QpfC-F7t7So9BktQhElDVnSLqej2RfRGTSv0LtqpQ1r0o/s320/liarsdrums.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfQyv7OaivQL3nr2YjrVteSYj9UcOtwqSOjnhZu9P5j4ujtTrhEXWfkWUJQlJNWeL69DGgTQIJr9K0ERvLvgaWG36po598q1QpfC-F7t7So9BktQhElDVnSLqej2RfRGTSv0LtqpQ1r0o/s1600/liarsdrums.jpg)

But how can a listener from this YouTube rediscovery period imagine hearing this, as a Japanese shopper in MUJI circa 1984? Even beyond this, sans one track (I am not entirely sure which one), the music was supposedly never played as intended. Given this last fact, it may be fitting indeed that the album’s resurgence be in a form entirely unintended by its creator – a recontextualization of that which was never truly properly contextualized to begin with.

Recontextualization in (and of) music has become synonymous with the internet, but the newfound attention towards *Watering a Flower* suggests the possibility that something akin to a homemade mixtape could easily usurp an official release in terms of what an audience thinks of when they think of a particular composition. Even consider the strange recent history of Diana Ross’s ‘It’s Your Move’ – a song more familiar to an entire generation of internet denizens and young people in general as a chopped and screwed vaporwave mix.

The new context of *Watering a Flower* is entirely part of the strangeness of the release. The history of this music is so embedded into the music itself that it therefore becomes impossible not to consider it as one listens. However, due to the history being shadowed and fragmented, the person who recontextualized the album and sparked its resurgence (whoever that may be), either purposefully or accidentally was able to capitalize on this ripe vagueness. They have created something of a fabricated history that is now equally essentially to understanding how the album sounds. On RateYourMusic’s database both *花に水* and *Watering a Flower* are cataloged as separate releases. Although this may eventually change, per site guidelines, for the time being it attests to the way that the simple reframing and rediscovery of this music essentially created a new and separate work of art.

Or: what is the difference between hearing Hosono’s ambient music in a MUJI in 1984, or in 2017 on YouTube? Massive, presumably. How does the presentation of a work completely alter its meaning, or intent? Significantly, I suppose. And how does the authorship shift or become collaborative when someone drastically, or even subtly, alters the context? (That last one’s honestly a boring and overworked question – nevermind.)

Beyond these rhetorical inquiries, these sorts of new presentations allow art to further expand – just as a genre like plunderphonics was born simply by reframing old sounds. By drawing comparisons between various art pieces, and by placing them within new contexts, hidden meanings emerge, or new significance is born altogether. Within an intentionally open-ended form like ambient music, the effect is amplified. And with the wide and unhinged playground of the internet, one can provide a catalyst for thought and inspiration simply by uploading an overlooked recording.

**Context, as in space:**

 The proposed usage of *Watering a Flower* would have nearly turned MUJI into a sort of installation space, where sound art occupies the surrounding. The idea reminds me of a similarly uneasy ambient recording, *The Decriminalisation of Country Music: Themes for Tramway* by English experimental group :zoviet\*france:. Another commissioned recording, the album uses sounds from the construction of the Tramway arts centre in Glasgow as the industrial basis for its composition. It is an abstracted documentation of the process of the creation of the arts centre, but turned musical, and so it attests to the transformative nature of art as a whole – as we listen to music created with the sounds of the symbolic creation of art itself. But the music sounds mournful, creepy, dissonant, unnerving, industrial. It sounds like construction and literal transformation, like heavy materials being shaped and molded. As a soundscape for a space, it alludes to the physicality of that space – the tangible material of its physical history. It’s this cyclical and symbiotic thing, where the creation is integral to the art.

*Watering a Flower* just as easily links its art with its creation, with the identity of MUJI and the commissioning of the music so baked into every iteration of its presentation that to neglect it would be wrong.

It is also worth noting the comparison to Brian Eno’s pioneering recordings in the *Ambient* series, particularly the first installment *Ambient 1: Music for Airports* (Eno coined the term ‘ambient music’). Inspired by the drab sound in a German airport, Eno conceived of the idea of a sound installation that would "accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular.” Eno saw ambient music as something contemplative, that allowed for one to engage with it on various levels, or if they chose, not at all. The versatility is apparent, even when contrasted with the specificity of an album like *Ambient 1*, which was specifically conceived and created with the space of an airport in mind.

At home, as close listening, these ambient recordings take on new shape. But it remains unfortunate that you rarely are able to hear installed sound art outside of a specific gallery setting. Even still, the either curated or coincidental soundscape of the supermarket and coffeehouse provide interesting insights into the way shops and businesses brand and market themselves, and therefore involves a question of how the use of this music influences behavior and response within and to said environment. However, they often lack the symbiosis of these sorts of ambient pieces. But one may have to take a trip to MUJI and play Hosono’s music on their headphones to see what’s really going on there.

Contrary to the Eno and :zoviet\*france: recordings, *Watering a Flower* seems like an exaggeration of the strangeness of a shop, when one considers it. The way everything has been conveniently arranged and displayed, and the way one in modernity does not need to fish, or hunt, or grow to survive, but can instead stroll and buy. The use of the phrase ‘watering a flower’ as the title seemingly alludes to this, where the simple necessity of watering a plant for it to grow is subverted and clouded by the process of modern capitalism – where things arrive neatly on shelves pre-packaged, without fuss, ready for consumption. The neat, tidy, cheerful, but ultimately scary sounds of the music feel jam-packed with this sort of commentary on the uncanny. The repetition of the music alludes to the careful and monotonous process of growing a plant, but framed as background music the intention is that shoppers allow these sorts of processes to fade into the background.

With its strange and vague history of release and recontextualization, it works best as this strange and somewhat inexplicable collection of sounds. Like the aforementioned manner in which the internet can shift, alter and reframe history, Hosono’s music seems to be at once exciting, mysterious, distressing and wondrous.

**Worth noting:**

\-The following blog post provides a concise explanation of *Watering a Flower*’s basic history:  
http://glob.daniel-letson.com/posts/haruomi-hosono-watering-a-flower/

\-One might consider exploring the recent exposé of Spotify’s ‘fake’ ambient artists, as a peculiar way in which this genre is able to be manipulated in terms of its presentation. Does the dishonest framing of this music disrupt its worth? I don’t know. But the positioning within a Spotify playlist is a peculiar context – and the commissioning of music for these playlists resembles the origin of *Watering a Flower* in several key ways.

\-Haruomi Hosono is one of the most prolific musical geniuses of the 20th and 21st century. From his work within Yellow Magic Orchestra and Happy End, to his various solo projects, to his hundreds upon hundreds of producer, musician, and writing credits on wide-reaching recordings, his body of work is well-worth exploring for anyone interested in contemporary pop or electronic music.

\-In regards to *The Decriminalisation of Country Music: Themes for Tramway*, it is worth considering that the intended audience for the piece was notably art crowds. Compared to the Hosono and Eno recordings referenced above, this recording is noticeably more abstract and inaccessible (save perhaps the beautiful opening cut ‘Something Spooked the Horses’). Eno’s ‘invention’ of ambient music asserted that it could exist as something for more general audiences than the strict art music that it perhaps most closely resembled. However, by purposefully sitting down to attentively listen to a complete ambient recording, one is putting it within a framework that is decidedly akin to this strict art music. As such, these compositions that were originally intended to be played as soundscapes while people shopped or waited for their plane, were both artistic and functional. This rediscovery (and subsequent popularity within internet music communities) of Hosono’s MUJI compositions likely implies that their greatest potential was in their presentation as stand-alone pieces. However, it is impossible to really know how they would function as such – the narrative and history surrounding them is quite inextricable at this point. I suppose a trip to MUJI is in order.
