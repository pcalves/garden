Hi! Iâ€™m [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/). Youâ€™ve stumbled upon my working notes. Theyâ€™re kind of strange, so some context might help.

These notes are mostly written for myself: theyâ€™re roughly my thinking environment ([Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX); [My morning writing practice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zHTevHGZQPu8QHpRhUmtsuK)). But Iâ€™m sharing them publicly as an experiment ([Work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ)). If a note seems confusing or under-explained, itâ€™s probably because I didnâ€™t write it for you! Sorryâ€”thatâ€™s sort of an essential tension of this experiment ([Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXDPrYcxUSZbF5M8vM5Y1U9)).

For now, thereâ€™s no index or navigational aids: youâ€™ll need to follow a link to some starting point. You might be interested in [Â§Whatâ€™s top of mind](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zPKTSiU725W9WQCqoVPBcxm).
