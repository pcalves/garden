Permacomputing is both a concept and a community of practice oriented around issues of [resilience](https://permacomputing.net/Resilience/) and regenerativity in computer and network technology inspired by [permaculture](https://permacomputing.net/permaculture/).

In a time where computing epitomizes industrial waste, permacomputing encourages the maximizing of hardware lifespans, minimizing energy use and focusing on the use of already available computational resources. We do this we want to find out how we can practice good relations with the Earth by learning from ecological systems to leverage and re-center existing technologies and practices. We are also interested in investigating what a permacomputing way of life could be, and what sort of transformative computational culture and aesthetics it could bring forward.

If you want to know more, please start reading about what is [permacomputing](https://permacomputing.net/permacomputing/) in essence, and then dive into its [principles](https://permacomputing.net/Principles/).

If you want to help, [here are some suggestions](https://permacomputing.net/getting_started/).

## Wiki

Started in May 2022, the permacomputing [wiki](https://permacomputing.net/wiki/) is where we maintain a set of principles, collectively document practical perspectives and interpretations of these principles, and offer more speculative reflections on permacomputing.

**The wiki is still at a very early stage of development,we are frequently working on it.**

This main page of the wiki is an index to the various topics covered. See "[about](https://permacomputing.net/about/)" for a more detailed discussion about the wiki itself.
