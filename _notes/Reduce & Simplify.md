This phrase is borrowed from [Jack Baty](../Jack%20Baty.md) who set it as a resolution for 2024. I’ve been turning it over my head as I’m going through the [Capacities → Obsidian migration](../Capacities%20%E2%86%92%20Obsidian%20migration.md). Using the least tools possible is a great way to [Reduce friction](./Reduce%20friction.md). Make the most of what you have already, [Choose the how once and stick with it](../Choose%20the%20how%20once%20and%20stick%20with%20it.md).

A practical example: looking for how to handle [Clippings](../Clippings.md) in Obsidian, I made some movement towards [Deploying a minimal self-hosted Omnivore using fly.io and bonsai.io](./Clippings/Deploying%20a%20minimal%20self-hosted%20Omnivore%20using%20fly.io%20and%20bonsai.io.md). It appeals to my preference for self-hosted apps, and my love of tinkering with stuff.

Turns out, Feedbin has had a [read later feature since 2019](https://feedbin.com/blog/2019/08/20/save-webpages-to-read-later/). Setting it up with Reeder was a breeze, and there’s a bookmarklet. So that’s a solved problem using tools I know well and plan to continue using until the heat death of the Sun.
