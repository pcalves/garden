I've been journaling daily for a while now. It's a great way of [[Checking in on myself regularly|Checking in on myself regularly]], keeping a record of dreams, thoughts, fears, recalling important events. It's a form of therapy, a creative exercise and a brain dump all rolled up into one.

Any medium or tools would do, but I've settled on the following:
1. [Enso](https://enso.sonnet.io/) for writing. I love how it blocks any editing, and how text fades away as I type, so the focus is less on the content and more on the act of writing
2. [Journal](https://www.journal.do/) is where the text is pasted onto for safe-keeping. I used to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)'s daily notes for this, but I like the idea of a laser-focused app. It makes for a much better reading experience. Just a bunch of tiny details that make it shine.

I've got into the habit of listening to Brian Eno's [1/1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKZ3fGR2SDY). It's pretty much the right length - 17 minutes - at is great at inducing a [[Flow state|Flow state]].
