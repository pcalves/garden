Currently (as of 24 March 2024) CEO of Obsidian.

Creates and deploys his homepage using Obsidian, and it contains a lot of notes of several subjects, well worth mining for inspiration (remember [Reading isn't enough; if you want to keep something, write it down](../Reading%20isn't%20enough;%20if%20you%20want%20to%20keep%20something,%20write%20it%20down.md)).
