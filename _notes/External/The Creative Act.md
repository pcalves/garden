### Patience
> Patience is required for crafting a work that resonates and contains all that we have to offer.
> 
> Every phase of an artist's work and life benefits from cultivating this achievable habit.
> 
> Patience is developed much like awareness. Through an acceptance of what is. Impatience is an argument with reality. The desire for something to be different from what we are experiencing in the here and now. A wish for time to speed up, tomorrow to come sooner, to relive yesterday, or to close your eyes then open them and find yourself in another place.
> 
> Time is something that we have no control over. So patience begins with acceptance of natural rhythms. The implied benefit of impatience is to save time by speeding up and skipping ahead of those rhythms. Paradoxically, this ends up taking more time and using more energy. It's wasted effort.

### Living as an artist
> Living life as an artist is a practice.
> 
> You are either engaging in the practice or you're not.
> 
> It makes no sense to say you're not good at it.
> 
> It's like saying, "I'm not good at being a monk." You are either living as a monk or you're not.
> 
> We tend to think of the artist's work as the output.
> 
> The real work of the artist is a way of being in the world.
