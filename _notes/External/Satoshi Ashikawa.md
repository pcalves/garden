Founded the record and book store Art Vivant in Ikebukuro, Tokyo in 1975. The shop was one of the first in Japan to import Brian Eno's *Ambient* records alongside a niche selection of avant garde and ethnographic LPs, and became a hub for the influential [Kankyō Ongaku](../../Kanky%C5%8D%20Ongaku.md) scene.

In 1982, Ashikawa co-founded the record label Sound Process with colleague Munetaka Tanaka, which soon grew into a sound design consultancy firm and book publisher. The label released three LPs as part of the [Wave Notation](../../Wave%20Notation.md) series.

Ashikawa was killed in a car accident in 1983. He was 30 years old.
