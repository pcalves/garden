It's easy to get swept up in an ever-ending stream of new apps. Each one promises to be the one thing that you were missing, to have that killer feature that will make things click into place.

I've fallen prey to this trap one too many times. Getting into a new app, finding just enough things about it that annoy me or add friction to the things I want to accomplish with it, only to abandon it for some shiny new toy. Rinse and repeat. Never settling into a proper habit, I fall into a state of impermanence, of indefinition. The appeal of the new i strong: the UI is beautiful, delightful. The communication too. 

Instead, one should strive to [[Choose the how once and stick with it|Choose the how once and stick with it]]. This implies a greater deal of scrutiny when selecting an app or service. Does it align with my values? Is it throwing up any red flags? Is it made to last? Made for users, or to attract VC interest? It also means being disciplined, establishing habits, learning the tools and working through their limitations. Or, rather, finding what it is one wants and then the best app or service that fits one's needs.
