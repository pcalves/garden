The following has been distilled mostly from [Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams](./External/Why%20We%20Sleep.md) and a lot of trial and error:

1. Try to go to sleep - and to wake up - at roughly the same time every day (weekends included)

2. iPhone has a custom Sleep [Focus](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/set-up-a-focus-iphd6288a67f/ios) enabled from 9:50pm to 06:45am, with:

    - No apps allowed

    - No calls allowed except from my partner

    - Home screen only shows [Calm](https://www.calm.com/app) (for the occasional wind-down exercise)

3. Laptop must be turned off and back at the office

4. No other screens allowed, except for maybe the Kindle

5. Optional: Do some light journaling using pen and paper if there are stray thoughts that need to be sorted

6. Read a book - non-negotiable

7. Take a hot shower before going to bed; it helps to relax, and to lower the body temperature

8. Spray some [Twilight Body Spray](https://www.lush.com/pt/en/p/twilight-body-spray) on pillow; it's a little silly but the smell really is soothing

9. Optional: Wear [Loop Quiet](https://www.loopearplugs.com/products/quiet) ear plugs if feeling anxious or neighbors are being especially noisy

10. Optional: Wear a padded sleep mask if partner wants to read

11. Last resort: Take Â½-1 Ambien - this isn't a real fix, as the quality of the sleep is overall much worse. But it beats thrashing about and feeling anxious
