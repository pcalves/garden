Distilled from [Advice That Actually Worked For Me](./Clippings/Advice%20That%20Actually%20Worked%20For%20Me.md):

## Maximise baseline energy levels

 If you start the day off right (i.e. exercizing, accomplishing something important) rather than resorting to the "sugary stuff" (like reading social media, Reddit, Discord), then you'll have a higher baseline that will help define the day

## [Tell the right stories about yourself](Tell%20the%20right%20stories%20about%20yourself.md)

State and restate the things that define you, then frame everything in the context of those statements. If I define myself as someone who gets things done, then not doing things is the exception, a temporary blip that will inevitably corrected. The same goes for everything. Stating your undeniable, unshakeable truths will help you achieve them.

## Write regularly

It's the way to clear the brain's "cache". Writing gets something out of your brain and into a more permanent space, where it can be iterated over, considered in a more measured manner, or simply discarded. It should be a daily habit, but it's fine if you only do it when it really feels necessary

## Synthesize the things you read

Like you just did for this [Advice That Actually Worked For Me](./Clippings/Advice%20That%20Actually%20Worked%20For%20Me.md). Take out the things you want to capture, restate them and, in doing so, they're more likely to stick in your mind, lead to further thought, research and actions. Get into the habit of capturing information using [Evergreen notes](./Evergreen%20notes.md).
