Ambient album about the creative process feedback loop.

1. Flow - the music is flowing freely and you are given to the process of creation
2. Elation - you are in love with your own creation, convinced it’s your greatest work yet
3. Comedown - you release your creation out into the world. It’s no longer yours. Letting go is hard and painful.
4. Void - normal life settles back in and two things happen at once. the rhythm of normal life is both appealing and unfulfilling. You long to be creating again as you just were, but starting things up gets harder every day
5. Dawn - The search for the next thing kicks off. It’s a hard process, like learning to walk all over again. Slow, painful, deliberate, but you keep at it
6. Ascent - You find it. A flame is ignited. The familiar warmth licks your soul and invigorates you. You know what comes next. You are ready
