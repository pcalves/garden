Having been doing this with [The Creative Act: A Way of Being](../The%20Creative%20Act.md), I'm wishing I would do the same for [Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism, and the World](../Palo%20Alto.md) and all other future books I read. Grabbing quotes from paper is easier than ever thanks to Apple's magical OCR, so there's no excuse to not snap anything that grabs your attention, anything that demands further investigation.
