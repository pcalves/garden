We often speak of time as if it's short or long. We don't have enough time for something, or, time stretches on forever.

[Rick Rubin](../Rick%20Rubin.md) writes the following on [Patience](../Patience.md) in [The Creative Act](../The%20Creative%20Act.md):
![The Creative Act > Patience](../The%20Creative%20Act.md#Patience)

Time simply flows, in much the same way as it always does and always has done, one second followed by the next.

All we can do is follow along and make the decisions that serve us best. Our time is limited, and so it's in our best interest to work around the limitations, instead of trying to break them.
