The rough idea started from a shower thought: what if I made pixel art in Ableton.

So this is the first one I did:

Immediately I had a ton of fun. A sprite becomes a set of MIDI notes, and those become your limitation. The notes are set, but you're free to play with everything else: the sounds they play, MIDI trickery like arps and chords, automation, effects, etc.

The second idea: what if I transpose a sprite _sheet_? A walking animation then becomes a track, each sprite a section.

And then: I want these to be ambient, looping tracks, and I want the loop to change over time. So now I'm after ways to mimic Disintegration Loops in Ableton.
