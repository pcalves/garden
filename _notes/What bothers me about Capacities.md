1. I really wish it was local-first and offline-first. Improved offline resilience is on the roadmap, as are automated backups, but it's still all about the cloud
2. Its pushing of AI as a first-class feature. Though I have to admit the `Fill Description` feature has come in handy
3. It has a much stronger whiff of VC about it than either Obsidian or Anytype
