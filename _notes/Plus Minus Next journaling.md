[Plus Minus Next](https://nesslabs.com/plus-minus-next) is a journaling method meant to be quick and easy - emphasizing [[Practice over process|Practice over process]]. It breaks a week down into three categories:
1. What worked (a.k.a. `+`)
2. What didn't work (a.k.a `-`)
3. What you plan to do next (a.k.a `â†’`)

> Whatever went well or made you happy goes in the first column; any negative events or inaction on your part in the second column; and all plans for the following week in the last column.

Here's an example:
