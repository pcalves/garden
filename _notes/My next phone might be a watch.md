I bought my first Apple Watch for two reasons:
1. Tracking health metrics like sleep, exercise and steps 
2. Acting as a buffer between myself and my iPhone

I’ve come to see [The smartphone as a digital pet](../The%20smartphone%20as%20a%20digital%20pet.md). It demands your attention and is great at keeping it once you’re in its sights. Even something as innocuous as checking a reminder or a message can turn into a black hole of wasted time.

In contrast, the smartwatch is blissfully passive. Even with all notifications turned on, there’s not a whole lot that you _can_ do on it that I’d consider a time waster. There’s no browser, no social media, no games. It feels more like a tool than a general-purpose computer.

My current watch has no eSIM, so it requires the iPhone for connectivity. I’m wondering what it’d be like to use only the Apple Watch. Looking at [What do I absolutely need my phone for?](./What%20do%20I%20absolutely%20need%20my%20phone%20for?.md), it’d pretty much cover my needs for GPS, communication and music. Other tasks I could offload to my laptop or to the household tablet that tends not to get that much use.
