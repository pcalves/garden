See: [[Epistemic status an explainer and some thoughts — EA Forum|Epistemic status an explainer and some thoughts — EA Forum]]

Epistemic statuses are short disclaimers at the top of a post that include biases, qualifications, effort spent in writing, and anything else that might provide context to the reader.

I [[Write for myself|Write for myself]] and will be [[Working with the garage door up|Working with the garage door up]] as much as possible, but still want to make sure people know where I'm coming from as I write certain things.
