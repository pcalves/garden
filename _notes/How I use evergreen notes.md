[[Evergreen notes|Evergreen notes]] are a great tool for capturing ideas. those can come from without, as I apply the concepts of [[Reading isn't enough; if you want to keep something, write it down|Reading isn't enough; if you want to keep something, write it down]], or sometime down the road, as the brain builds new connections.

Generally speaking, it should be fine to create a note with nothing but a title. The title itself should be descriptive enough as to capture the essence of the idea or concept. The text should then expand upon it and reflect my changing/expanding thoughts on it, as well as link out to any notes that emerge out of the process, or that are linked back to it by association.

It then becomes crucial to have two things:

1. [[A triage system for my evergreen notes|A triage system for my evergreen notes]]
2. [[A process for putting evergreen notes to work|A process for putting evergreen notes to work]]
