As I've set up my home page at [pcalv.es](https://pcalv.es) to function as an actual blog powered by Bear, I've been getting into the habit of posting regularly.

So far, this has consisted of me pulling up something from my [Evergreen notes](./Evergreen%20notes.md), working on it until it resembles something that can be shared and understood by an audience larger than myself, and letting it out into the world.

This works but it has a couple of problems:

1. Evergreen notes are, by definition, never done, so making a public note out of them is merely taking a snapshot and putting it out there. [Blog posts should be static](../Blog%20posts%20should%20be%20static.md)

2. It puts me in the wrong mindset; an evergreen note can be rambling, contradictory. It's meant for working things out, and the process is a messy one. If I self-correct and edit too much because I'm thinking ahead of the audience that will read the note, it'll impede the process

For now, my solution was to create a separate [object type in Capacities](https://capacities.io/content-types) called "Public Notes". Here's an example of one:

[Reject numbers, embrace connections](../Reject%20numbers,%20embrace%20connections.md)

These can link back to the note(s) that originated it. I can even end up copying and pasting most of one, or several, evergreen notes into a public note and serving it up as is. But creating this separation highlights the *intention* behind each type of note. And in the end, it should help me think more freely and clearly.
