The best kind of work I can do is the one that allows my fellow workers to continue to do their job without impedement.  In software development, this can take several forms.

## Pull Requests

Get to that Pull Request sooner rather than later. In fact, make it a top priority. I have an entire hour blocked out for code reviews every morning, right after catching up on notifications. I might not need that much time, but it makes sure that that work is prioritized.

## Documentation

If I'm in charge of writing any sort of documentation, make it a priority. Others will inevitably need it to implement or refactor features. Another advantage of doing it earlier: specs usually spark discussions. It often takes someone attempting to lay it all out for others to pick up on potential issues.

## Discussions

This one can be tough. Discussions can drag on for days, especially in a remote-first, async-first environment. Something like that can tend to fall down in the list of priorities. It also forms the bedrock upon which work happens: code is written based on specs, and those arise from a combination of discussions. So never leave a comment unattended for too often. The earlier you get to it, the more vibrant the discussion.
