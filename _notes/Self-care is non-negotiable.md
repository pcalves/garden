Make time for yourself. Even if there's someone in your life that _will_ do it for you, do not make it their job. Take care of yourself and you allow others to take care of themselves as well. Think of the times where you worried about someone. Maybe you questioned their habits, their vices, their wellbeing? In doing so, you had less time and energy to look to yourself.

It doesn't mean you lose empathy, or stop looking out for others. On the contrary! Opening up to yourself makes you more empathetic. You'll practise awareness and then can apply your learnings to your other relationships.

There's _always_ time to do that one thing you with you could do. Prioritize, then prioritize again. [[Reduce & Simplify|Reduce & Simplify]]. Put [[Practice over process|Practice over process]]. Remove the things that are working against you, and leave only those that work _for you_. In other words, [[Reduce friction|Reduce friction]] in all aspects of your life. [[Choose the how once and stick with it|Choose the how once and stick with it]] (see [[Decisions that make my life easier|Decisions that make my life easier]] for a few practical examples). When you take a hard look at the things that demand your attention, there's a chance you might find you can live without some of them. People too. Be deliberate in how you spend your time, on what, with whom.
