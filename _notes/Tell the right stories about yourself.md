From [[Identity-Based Habits|Identity-Based Habits]]:

> The key to [building lasting habits](https://jamesclear.com/habits) is focusing on creating a new identity first. Your current behaviors are simply a reflection of your current identity. What you do now is a mirror image of the type of person you believe that you are (either consciously or subconsciously).

> To change your behavior for good, you need to start believing new things about yourself. You need to build identity-based habits.
