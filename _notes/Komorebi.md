Komorebi (木漏れ日) is formed from the following japanese words:
1. 木 for "tree"
2. 漏れ for "to leak"
3. 日 for "sun"

It translates to "sunlight leaking through tress" and is meant to describe the fleeting, unique beauty of the interplay of un and trees that causes a shimmering of light and shadows that only exists at that moment.

It invites one to stop and notice. To appreciate the beauty in the seemingly mundane, everyday occurances.
