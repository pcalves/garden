Environmental music in the style of [[Kankyō Ongaku|Kankyō Ongaku]]. Meant to be listened to on speakers, not too loudly, preferable outside or with the windows wide open so the sounds of Nature and Man can mix in with the music.

To make this album, focus on short sessions, listen to the music without headphones, use the ambiance around you as another instrument or layer that's not encoded in the project but nonetheless imbues it and is a vital part of it.

Take inspiration from the [[Wave Notation|Wave Notation]] series, in particular [[Music For Nine Post Cards|Music For Nine Post Cards]].
