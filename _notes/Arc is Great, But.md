Arc is, in one word, _delightful_. The entire experience of installing, setting up and using the browser is filled to the brim with excitement. You can feel it pouring out of its team onto every crevice of the app. It's been my default browser for well over a year at this point. 

And yet.

There's at least two things that annoy me about Arc. One big, one small, but both have me thinking about switching to anything else often enough.

## The Small Gripe

Arc doesn't do bookmarklets. Maybe because it doesn't really do bookmarks? not in the traditional sense, at least. But whereas the alternative feels at least as good, if not better, for bookmarks (tabs can be as ephemeral or as permanent as you'd like, plus you can set up folders, the lack of proper bookmarklet support is baffling. 

I've resorted to using an extension called [Powerlet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/powerlet/ofecodkcadbenmiknnidnfepbblapgkn), which is just fine, but doesn't synchronise across profiles or devices, thus breaking the portability of the browser.

## The Big Gripe

Arc is going all-in on A.I., with features that allow users to summarise the content of pages and even a "Browse for Me" feature that acts like a souped-up search that spits out a full page instead of a list of search results.

They sum it up thus ([source](https://www.macstories.net/news/the-browser-company-announces-act-ii-for-arc-the-browser-that-browses-for-you/)):
> Here is our vision. Itâ€™s really simple. You tell Arc what to do, and Arc will go and do it for you

There are a lot of companies right now trying to insert A.I. between yourself and your computer and/or the internet (see: [Rabbit R1](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24030667/rabbit-r1-ai-action-model-price-release-date), [Reflect](https://reflect.app/home), and so on.

I'm hesitant about these kinds of features, to say the least.
