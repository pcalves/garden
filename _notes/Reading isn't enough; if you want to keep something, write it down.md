See [Learning pyramid](../Learning%20pyramid.md) for some (slightly questionable) research on how engaging with the same material in different ways affects knowledge retention.

From a purely anecdotical standpoint, writing something down in my own words is an invaluable tool for acquiring and solidifying knowledge. It forces me into an analytical mode. In synthesizing something, I'm reading the source(s) again, thinking on them.

Moreover, by [Setting up my own digital garden](./Setting%20up%20my%20own%20digital%20garden.md), I provide the space for links between ideas to be generated outside of my messy, forgetful brain. This can further help solidify learnings or, more importantly, give way to new ideas and thoughts, which I then can choose to write down and send out into the world.
