Life is a never-ending barrage of choices, decisions and compromises. The following is a list of decisions that I've made. Once you decide on something you can let it go, or rather let it become a part of you, and reduce the number of choices. Inspired by [[Steph Ango|Steph Ango]]'s [[Style is consistent constraint|Style is consistent constraint]].

## Self-care
- I shave my hair at least once a month (going to the hairdresser but looking into DIY)
- I shave my face 3 times per week
- I follow [[My sleep routine|My sleep routine]] to promote consistently good sleep

## Technology
- If the software supports it, I use the [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) theme
- Light mode during the day, Dark mode at night
- I enable [Night Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Shift_%28software%29) or any similar software on every device to reduce blue night at night
- Tags and other tag-like properties using kebab case (e.g. `notes`, `self-improvement`, `things-i-want`)
	- whenever it makes sense, I use the plural form of the word (i.e. `lists` instead of `list`)
- For local software, single payment over subscription models
- For online services, open-source over closed-source, self-hosted whenever possible, [[100% user-supported|100% user-supported]] over VC, paid over free
- I don't have social media accounts and will not create accounts on any platform that measures the performance of human-to-human interactions by "likes", "reposts" or other similar metrics. This is as much out of a regard for my mental health as it is for any opinions I have on social media in general
	- The one exception to this rule is [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/) which has a very light "Upvote" functionality that doesn't significantly impact the experience (I'm there mostly to [[Write for myself|Write for myself]])
- I am always reachable by email, and seek to reach out to others in the same way. Email has been around for a while and it'll likely be around for as long I'm alive

## Things
- My water bottle is the [Kambukka Etna Grip 500 ml Black Steel](https://www.kambukka.com/collections/travel-mug/products/etna-grip-500-ml-black-steel). It has replaceable components and great cleaning tools, so it should last me forever
- I wear mostly monochromatic clothes with the occasional splashes of color. Simplicity and comfort over all else
	- I buy my clothes from MUJI and H&M, occasionally from COS and Scotch & Soda
	- I buy my shoes from MUJI or Adidas, my boots from Camper (looking into vegan alternatives)
- I write with the [Gel Ink Ballpoint Pen 0.5mm](https://www.muji.eu/products/gel-ink-ballpoint-pen-0-5mm-11046) from MUJI (and always have 1+ [refills](https://www.muji.eu/products/refill-gel-ink-ballpoint-pen-0-5mm-11048) in my desk) on [Rhodia Desk Webnotebooks with Dot Grid Ruling](https://rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_webnotebooks_desk.php) notebooks

## Media
- Purchases over rentals, but not dogmatic about it
- For purchases, DRM-free is the only way to go.
	- For books, try to support your local bookshops. If buying through Kindle, use [[DeDRM tools for ebooks|DeDRM tools for ebooks]]
- Music is (1) bought on Bandcamp, or (2) streamed via TIDAL. Anything that I listen to more than a couple of times on TIDAL I will seek out and purchase, then grab FLACs for my self-hosted media server
- Streaming services are a necessary evil for now
