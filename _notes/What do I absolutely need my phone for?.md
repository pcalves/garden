Trying to figure out ways to [[../Become untethered|Become untethered]].

## GPS
When I'm out and about I mostly know where to go. When I grab my car I need GPS for going to new places. Maybe I could try using the GPS built into my car, see how it compares to the apps on my phone.

## Music
I hardly ever listen to music on my phone anymore. Sometimes it's nice to listen to music when going out, but I'm mostly happy to go out into the world without any filters and just experience the outside to its fullest. While in the car, I've foregone music a lot of times for the same reason. It's nice for long rides, though, but maybe there's a better alternative.

## The Internet
It's nice to have it available at your fingertips, but do you really _need_ to be online at all times? More often than not I use it as a distraction, under the excude of checking up on things: RSS, Email, analytics, Slack, messages. All things that shouldn't require constant care or attention.

## Reminders
Most of these can live on my computer since they’re work-related. Others, like habits and chores, maybe be better suited as part of a very light sort of bullet journal that I can keep on me at all times. Even post-it notes on my desk for things that I absolutely can’t forget about. 

The idea of tracking events, chores and habits on paper is starting to appeal to me. Obsidian is great for that stuff, but it tethers me to my phone. It’s good for work or long-term personal projects. But the day-to-day stuff can be more ephemeral.o

## Lists
Have a tearaway notebook handy. Jot things down as needed. Discard once no longer needed.

## Photos
I don't take many pictures. However, having the phone handy has allowed me to capture a lot of great moments in my son's life, and may actually be the strongest argument for keeping a smartphone. For other times, such as when going out, an actual camera would be preferable.

## Deliveries
Do apps like Uber Eats, Glovo and Bolt really only work in smartphones? These are apps I rely on often. Of course, a long-standing goal in my household is to use them as little as possible.
