status: A very barebones description for a concept that is better established in my head than it is here. Others have written about it at length and I'm not sure I have a lot to add on the subject.

Evergreen notes, as coined by [[Andy Matuschak|Andy Matuschak]] and exemplified by [[Andy's Working Notes|Andy's Working Notes]], are meant to be "never done", atomic containers for concepts or ideas. Titles can be as descriptive as necessary, and they're meant to be linked together: one evergreen note can unfold into dozens more, as the process of writing and the thinking evolves.

[[How I use evergreen notes|How I use evergreen notes]] is, likewise, a developing process, but at least I think they fit my mental model a little better than [[The Zettelkasten Method|The Zettelkasten Method]].
