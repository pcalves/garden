Evergreen notes, as coined by [Andy Matuschak](./External/Andy%20Matuschak.md) and exemplified by [Andy's Working Notes](./Clippings/Andy's%20Working%20Notes.md), are meant to be "never done", atomic containers for concepts or ideas. Titles can be as descriptive as necessary, and they're meant to be linked together: one evergreen note can unfold into dozens more, as the process of writing and the thinking evolves.

[How I use evergreen notes](./How%20I%20use%20evergreen%20notes.md) is, likewise, a developing process, but at least I think they fit my mental model a little better than [The Zettelkasten Method](../The%20Zettelkasten%20Method.md).
