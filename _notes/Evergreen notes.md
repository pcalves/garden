Evergreen notes, as coined by [[./External/Andy Matuschak|Andy Matuschak]] and exemplified by [[./Clippings/Andy's Working Notes|Andy's Working Notes]], are meant to be "never done", atomic containers for concepts or ideas. Titles can be as descriptive as necessary, and they're meant to be linked together: one evergreen note can unfold into dozens more, as the process of writing and the thinking evolves.

[[./How I use evergreen notes|How I use evergreen notes]] is, likewise, a developing process, but at least I think they fit my mental model a little better than [[../The Zettelkasten Method|The Zettelkasten Method]].
