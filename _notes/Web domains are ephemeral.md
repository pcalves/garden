## Web domains are ephemeral

Domains can and do change hands. A domain can be pointed at some files today, and something entirely different the next day. And at nothing at all the next week.

What's the closest analogue to a domain? Is it a house? Or more accurately, an address? An address can signify many differents over years or decades.
