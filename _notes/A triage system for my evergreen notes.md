[Evergreen notes](./Evergreen%20notes.md) might be created in a moment of high focus. Maybe you're reading something that's sparking multiple ideas, or with many concepts that you want to capture and make your own (see [Reading isn't enough; if you want to keep something, write it down](./Reading%20isn't%20enough;%20if%20you%20want%20to%20keep%20something,%20write%20it%20down.md)). Or, maybe you're writing something an making connections as you go. Or maybe you're out for a walk, doing chores, anything where your mind is left to wander, and something comes to you.

Whatever the case, it's important to [Avoid context switching](../Avoid%20context%20switching.md) as much as possible. So simply turn a phrase into a note and continue writing.

Then, setup a routine whereby you go through your [empty notes](../Notes.md#Triage) and fill in the details. The note title itself should be enough to re-activate whatever thought you had. If not, then maybe you can go back to where the note originated. Or, if nothing seems to be working, you can just discard the note.
