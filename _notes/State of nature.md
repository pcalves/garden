[[Thomas Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]] defines the state of nature as a "war as is of every man against every man", with each individual possessing the right to do anything they think necessary to preserve their own life. Life in that state, thus, is "solitary, poor,Â [nasty, brutish, and short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasty,_brutish,_and_short "Nasty, brutish, and short")"

Within the state of nature, there is neither personal property nor injustice since there is no law, except for certain natural precepts discovered by reason:
1. "every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it" 
2. "that a man be willing, when others are so too, as far forth as for peace and defence of himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself"

[[David Grann|David Grann]] mentions this Hobbesian state of nature many times in [[The Wager|The Wager]]. That book describes the breakdown of a naval unit of men when facing with terrible circumstances: marooned, sick, with little to no food and drink and little shelter in one of the most inhospitable locations imaginable.

_The Wreck of the Wager_

More interestingly, it describe the lengths the British Empire went through to keep up the facade of civilization, despite the events that took place on the island (murder, mutiny, theft. cannibalism).
