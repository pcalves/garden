This phrase is borrowed from [[Jack Baty|Jack Baty]] who set it as a resolution for 2024. I’ve been turning it over my head as I’m going through the [[Capacities → Obsidian migration|Capacities → Obsidian migration]]. Using the least tools possible is a great way to [[./Reduce friction|Reduce friction]]. Make the most of what you have already, [[Choose the how once and stick with it|Choose the how once and stick with it]].

A practical example: looking for how to handle [[Clippings|Clippings]] in Obsidian, I made some movement towards [[../[[Clippings|Deploying a minimal self-hosted Omnivore using fly.io and bonsai.io]]/Deploying a minimal self-hosted Omnivore using fly.io and bonsai.io]]. It appeals to my preference for self-hosted apps, and my love of tinkering with stuff.

Turns out, Feedbin has had a [read later feature since 2019](https://feedbin.com/blog/2019/08/20/save-webpages-to-read-later/). Setting it up with Reeder was a breeze, and there’s a bookmarklet. So that’s a solved problem using tools I know well and plan to continue using until the heat death of the Sun.
